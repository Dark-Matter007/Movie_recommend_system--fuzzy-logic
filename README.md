Using Fuzzy Logic to Generate Movie Suggestions Using Ratings From Other Users 
I decided to use fuzzy logic to generate movie suggestions for users from other users’ 
data. I have seen systems like this in IMDB, Netflix, and other movie database website. I wanted 
to see how well fuzzy logic would work in these situations. The aim of my system is to gather 
movie rating data from the user and to create a fuzzy set with it. It then uses that fuzzy set to 
compare how similar the ratings of other users’ are. Using this similarity comparison, it suggests 
movies that it thinks the user would like based on the ratings of other users.
